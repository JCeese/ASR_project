Connection with Google, Baidu and Iflytek ASR API

通过连接Google、讯飞、百度的语音识别API，实现音频自动上传，自动保存识别结果在终端。

注意：
代码中的API key都需要换成自己在官网申请的；
关于不同语言的支持情况，可以查看官网；
百度ASR返回的粤语识别结果是简体，如果需要转换成繁体，需要自行转换，文件夹中有转换代码。

By connecting the voice recognition APIs of Google, Xunfei and Baidu, the audio files can be automatically uploaded, and the recognition results can be automatically saved at the terminal. 

Precautions:
The API key in the code needs to be replaced by the one you applied for on the official website.
For support on different languages, you can check the official website.
The Cantonese recognition result returned by Baidu ASR is Simplified. If you need the Traditional Chinese version, you need to convert it yourself, and the converting code is contained in the file.
